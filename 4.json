            "synopsis": "At the tender age of twelve, Mitsuki Kouyama has a sarcoma in her throat. Though this rare cancer can be cured by removing her vocal cords, Mitsuki refuses because of her desire to become a pop singer and keep her childhood promise to Eichi Sakurai, her first love who left for America. Unable to both heal and keep her voice, she allows her health to deteriorate as she accepts her tragic fate. One day, while escaping the home of her music-hating grandmother to attend an audition, Mitsuki meets two shinigami Takuto Kira and Meroko Yui. Realizing that Mitsuki can see them, Takuto and Meroko reveal to her that she will die in a year. Moved by her plight, Takuto allows Mitsuki the chance to pursue her dream by giving her the ability to transform into a healthy sixteen-year-old girl. After being chosen for a contract with Seed Records, Mitsuki makes her debut under the stage name Full Moon and chooses to pursue her dream music career before her life's end.

            "synopsis": "Fifty years ago, the wielders of the sacred Rave stones fought against an onslaught caused by demon stones called Dark Bring. This war resulted in an explosion known as \"Overdrive\"—a blast so powerful that it sent the Dark Bring into a deep slumber and scattered the pieces of Rave across the world. In the present, Haru Glory lives a peaceful life on Garage Island until one day, he catches the creature Plue while fishing. Plue is later recognized by Shiba Roses, an old man who happens to be the original Rave Master. Shiba explains that the Dark Bring has resurfaced, and that to stop it, assembling the scattered parts of Rave is of utmost urgency. However, before Shiba can leave on this mission, he is attacked by a soldier from the evil organization Demon Card, forcing him to transfer the power of Rave to Haru. With the fate of humankind resting on his shoulders, the new Rave Master begins his quest to find the scattered Rave fragments. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Negi Springfield, a 10-year-old wizard who recently graduated from Merdiana Magic Academy in Wales, hopes to achieve two things—to find his missing father, who was once known as the Thousand Master, and to become a Magister Magi, someone who helps the everyday world through magic. To reach his latter goal, he is assigned one last task: to teach English at a middle school in Japan. Much to his surprise and dismay, he not only discovers that his homeroom class consists of 31 girls, but also ends up revealing his true identity as a magician to Asuna Kagurazaka, one of his new students. Negi must now negotiate with the girl and face his most difficult challenge yet—to keep his identity a secret as he tackles magical threats both from within and outside of Mahora Academy, all the while keeping a watchful eye out for his lost father.

            "synopsis": "It is said that if a couple gets into the University of Tokyo together, they will live happily ever after. However, for Keitarou Urashima, UTokyo is a distant dream. After failing the entrance exams twice already, he decides to stay at his grandmother's inn in Tokyo in order to prepare for his third attempt. He is, therefore, surprised when he finds out that not only has his grandmother gone on a long vacation, but the inn has also become the Hinata House, an all-girls dormitory! Unfortunately for Keitarou, a series of misunderstandings during his first visit leave him with five untrusting tenants. But when Haruka Urashima, his aunt who works at the dorm, brings up that he is supposedly a UTokyo student, the girls' impressions of him quickly change, and they reluctantly allow him to stay. Feeling guilty about the lie, he slowly gets to know his new neighbors: the cute yet violent Naru Narusegawa, the cheeky and opportunistic Mitsune Konno, the soft-spoken Shinobu Maehara, the straight-laced Motoko Aoyama, and the mischievous Kaolla Su. Thus continues the unpopular Keitarou's difficult journey to get into UTokyo, all for the chance to fulfill his childhood promise to the only girl who has ever shown any interest in him and maybe, just maybe, meet her again...

            "synopsis": "Yukino Miyazawa is the perfect model student. Pretty, kind, good at sports, always at the top of her class. But she's not all that she seems. It's all an act of deception; she is really the self-confessed 'queen of vanity,' and her only goal in life is winning the praise and admiration of everyone around her. When she enters high school, she finally meets her match: Souichirou Arima, a handsome, athletic, popular, and very intelligent young boy. Ever since he stole the top seat in the class from her, Yukino has hated him, and has been plotting on how to take back her former place as the object of all other students' admiration. What she wasn't expecting, however, was that Souichirou, the very boy she hated, would confess his love for her. Or that he would find out about her deception—and use it to blackmail her! Together, they discover that they have more in common than they knew, and they slowly begin to bring out each other's inner selves.

Sana's outgoing and friendly nature leads her to work towards correcting all of the problems around her. Her 'meddling' irritates Hayama but at the same time captivates him, just as Hayama's gloomy nature irritates Sana and compels her to change him. As these two opposites attract each other, they face many hardships which bring them closer to a mutual understanding. (Source: ANN)",

            "synopsis": "When Hikaru Shindou discovers an old go board in his grandfather's attic, he is greeted by the spirit of an ancient go master, Fujiwara no Sai. Sai spent his life teaching the techniques of the board game to an emperor during the Heian era, and now in his ghostly state, he is eager to share his passion with the unsuspecting Hikaru. The only problem is that Hikaru is not all that interested in board games. But Sai is not easily dissuaded. Pressured by Sai's unrelenting desire to pursue something he refers to as the \"Divine Move,\" Hikaru begrudgingly consents to playing the game, executing moves as dictated by Sai. But slowly, intrigued by the dedication of his peers, he begins to learn the basics of the game. As Hikaru enters into the world of go, guided by his intangible tutor and inspired by his rival, Akira Touya, he cannot help but be drawn into the complex game as he grows determined to prove his own abilities. In a coming-of-age story centering around an ancient board game, Hikaru no Go tells the story of a boy maturing through the pursuit of his newfound passion. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, the sisters' lives are turned upside down when their father announces that he has promised one of them to be married to a fellow martial artist's son in hopes of carrying on the family legacy. In addition to their mixed reactions, when the fiancé arrives, the last thing the Tendou family expects is Ranma Saotome and his father, Genma. Ranma has been training in China with his father until an unfortunate accident changed them both. Now, when water touches them, Ranma turns into a girl and Genma into a giant panda. Ranma ½ follows Ranma as he attempts to get along with his newly betrothed, the youngest of the Tendou sisters, Akane. As the two begin to attend the same school, they deal with fellow friends and rivals, all of whom have something to say about their engagement. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "At Ouran High School, an academy where only the children of the rich and powerful attend, there exists a club consisting of the most elite of the student body: the legendary Host Club. Within the club's room, six beautiful, bored boys spend their time entertaining equally beautiful and bored girls. Haruhi Fujioka, a poor scholarship student, has no interest in the Host Club—until she breaks a valuable vase in their clubroom. After being mistaken for a boy, Haruhi is forced by Kyouya Ootori to work for the Host Club to repay her debt. Tamaki Suou, the princely leader of the club, eagerly takes her under his wing to teach her the ways of the host. Things, however, are never quite so simple with the Host Club around. Even the most mundane events can turn into huge spectacles with the likes of prankster twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, stoic Takashi Morinozuka, and sweet Mitsukuni \"Hunny\" Haninozuka. The crazy adventures of the Host Club are just beginning, and Haruhi must learn how to survive in the glitzy world of the hosts. [Written by MAL Rewrite] Note: The final volume contains a special bonus chapter where the group travels to Spain.",

After all, she also has feelings for his friend. Unluckily, however, their respective crushes fall for each other instead. Determined to find new love after their recent misfortunes, the pair decide to cheer each other on while maintaining their usual dynamic of constant bickering. Although they continually deny it, Risa and Ootani are more similar than they like to admit: they both have unusual heights, failing grades, identical tastes in food, and a tendency to act extremely childish. Together, they inspire laughter among their peers as a so-called comedic duo. Could the love that these two are looking for be closer than they think?

            "synopsis": "In the not too distant future, mankind battles over O-Parts, relics from an ancient civilization. It takes a special kind of person to unlock the full potential of these remnants from the past, and a unique breed of humans known as O.P.T.s (or O-Parts Tacticians) become a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, O-Parts can be used for good or evil purposes. Jio is a young boy with a tragic past who only trusts one thing in the world: money. Little does he suspect that he is actually a very powerful O.P.T., and inside him sleeps a demon of incredible ferocity. He meets up with a girl named Ruby, and together they decide to embark on a dangerous quest to discover as many O-Parts as they can. Will Jio help Ruby realize her dream of becoming a world famous treasure hunter? More importantly, will Ruby help Jio realize his dream of--world domination?!

One day, while leaving for school, he is greeted with a surprise: an unfamiliar, older girl in a frilly black dress is waiting by his front door, asking to be friends with him! Despite his attempts at ignoring her, the strange girl determinedly follows Kotarou all the way to school and back. Giving in, Kotarou finds out that the strange girl's name is Misha and that she is his new neighbor, supposedly from Heaven to work on becoming a full-time angel. What will become of Kotarou and his life with this \"clingy angel\"? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As she does not have any friends and performs poorly at school, her mean-spirited aunt resents having to take care of her. Wholeheartedly believing that God will grant her salvation one day, she tightly holds onto the ring that her mother passed down to her. Seeking solace by spending time at her late cat's grave, Karin unexpectedly meets a boy named Kazune Kuujou, who claims he is looking for God. However, Kazune calls her weak for relying on her deceased cat for comfort. Angered by the insult, Karin subconsciously channels energy into her mother's ring. Soon enough, she begins to excel at school and classmates compliment her for the first time. Unbeknownst to her, the ring has bestowed her godly powers. The revelation of the ring's transcendent strength catches the eyes of not only Kazune but also more sinister figures who wish to take advantage of Karin for nefarious purposes. Karin must now use her newly acquired gift to fight back against these malicious forces, unaware of the truth behind her heritage and the existence of others with similar abilities.

            "synopsis": "Imperial Academy is an elite private school whose student body is divided into the ranks of Gold, Silver, and Bronze. Depending on your family's wealth and your individual merit, you can be classified as a Silver or Bronze student. However, there is only one Gold student, and this year that person is Shizumasa Touguu—nicknamed \"the Emperor\" because he is the Student Council President. When she was very young, Haine Otomiya fell in love with Shizumasa, after reading the children's picture book that he authored. She had met him twice before attending Imperial Academy, but as a Bronze student, her rank is far below his, so she has been unable to approach him at school. Haine jumps at an opportunity to get close to Shizumasa, and she unexpectedly becomes his bodyguard as well as a member of the Student Council. It seems like a dream come true for her, but soon she will learn that everyone in the Student Council is hiding secrets, and her own shameful history cannot be forgotten either.

He searches endlessly for a mythical set of 12 Rings of the Dead—jewelry said to give life to the possessor. These rings are hunted by mercenaries and outlaws alike for a wide variety of reasons, but Gamma seeks to grant himself eternal life by possessing all 12. Gamma comes across teenager John Elwood Shepherd in his travels, who decides to follow Gamma after a brutal fight claims the life of his sister. Elwood seeks to use the Rings of the Dead to bring his sister back to life and quickly develops an admiration for Gamma, whose combat prowess saves Elwood's life time after time. Along the way, the two travelers encounter new friends and old allies from Gamma's past, working with them to defeat enemies who seek to use the Rings of the Dead for their own nefarious purposes.

Working alongside his cool-headed partner Sven Vollfied, they hunt down wanted criminals.

However, the motley crew soon discovers a terrible plot to revolutionize the world, and the mastermind is someone Train knows and loathes with a passion.

            "synopsis": "Busou Renkin is the story of the teenager Kazuki Mutou, who dies trying to save a girl who was being attacked by an eerie monster. The next morning, however, Kazuki is left wondering whether it was all a dream. Lo and behold, the girl, the monster, and his death are all real! The girl, Tokiko Tsumura, was actually trying to slay the homunculus (a beast that can take the form of humans, but whose main source of food is people), but Kazuki got in her way. To revive Kazuki, Tokiko replaces his heart with a \"kakugane,\" an alchemic device that allows him to summon a lance with which to fight the monsters. It turns out that Tokiko is a member of Renkin Kenshi (Alchemist Soldiers)—an organization sworn to protect the world from the diabolical creatures. Soon, Kazuki joins Tokiko in her quest to terminate the sinister being that creates and controls the homunculus. (Source: VIZ Media) Included one-shot: Volume 10: Embalming: Dead Body and Bride",

            "synopsis": "Bulma, a headstrong 16-year-old girl, is on a quest to find the mythical Dragon Balls—seven scattered magic orbs that grant the finder a single wish. She has but one desire in mind: a perfect boyfriend. On her journey, Bulma stumbles upon Gokuu Son, a powerful orphan who has only ever known one human besides her. Gokuu possesses one of the Dragon Balls, it being a memento from his late grandfather. In exchange for it, Bulma invites Gokuu to be a companion in her travels. By Bulma's side, Gokuu discovers a world completely alien to him. Powerful enemies embark on their own pursuits of the Dragon Balls, pushing Gokuu beyond his limits in order to protect Bulma and their growing circle of allies. However, Gokuu has secrets unbeknownst to even himself; the incredible strength within him stems from a mysterious source, one that threatens the many people he grows to hold dear. As his prowess in martial arts flourishes, Gokuu attracts stronger opponents whose villainous plans could collapse beneath his might. He undertakes the endless venture of combat training to defend his loved ones and the fate of the planet itself. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
            "background": "Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga series of all time, with over 230 million copies sold worldwide with 157 million in Japan alone, making it the third all-time best selling manga as of 2015, and the #1 manga series not currently publishing. The series is often credited for the \"Golden Age of Jump\" where the magazine's circulation was at its highest. VIZ Media serialized the manga in English from March 1998 to March 2005 in monthly comic book anthology format; and was later collected into traditional tankobon format volumes from March 12, 2003 to June 6, 2006. To closer follow the English anime localization, the series is split; in which volumes 17-42 are titled Dragon Ball Z and renumbered as volumes 1-26. Other releases by VIZ include the large format VIZ Big Edition, kanzenban cover based 3-in-1 Edition, and a Full Color Edition of chapters 195-245. Other English publishers include Madman Entertainment in Australia/New Zealand, and the now defunct Gollancz Manga (distribution rights transferred to VIZ) in the United Kingdom. The series is also published in Spanish by Planet DeAgostini Cómics and in French by Glénat Editions.",

            "synopsis": "During the Edo period, Japan is suddenly invaded by alien creatures known as the \"Amanto.\" Despite the samurai's attempts to combat the extraterrestrial menace, the Shogun soon realizes that their efforts are futile and decides to surrender. This marks the beginning of an uneasy agreement between the Shogunate and Amanto, one that results in a countrywide sword ban and the disappearance of the samurai spirit. However, there exists one eccentric individual who wields a wooden sword and refuses to let his samurai status die. Now that his kind are no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet. Joined by his self-proclaimed disciple Shinpachi Shimura, the fearsome alien Kagura, and a giant dog named Sadaharu, they run the business known as Yorozuya, often getting caught up in all sorts of crazy and hilarious shenanigans.

Suspecting the girl is his classmate Aya Toujou, Junpei sets out to get in touch with her to refilm that skirt flip for \"artistic\" reasons. However, when he bumps into her the next day, he sees a girl that looks vastly different from the one in his memories. Just when Junpei thinks he is back to the drawing board, he runs into the school's darling, Tsukasa Nishino, boldly declaring that she is wearing strawberry panties for the day. Convincing himself that Tsukasa is the girl he has been looking for all along, Junpei starts planning his confession—all for the sake of becoming her boyfriend and filming her panties!

            "synopsis": "The life of Tsunayoshi \"No-Good Tsuna\" Sawada is a complete wreck. Terrible grades, horrible fitness, and a non-existent social life means he has no reason to attend school, especially after discovering that his crush, Kyouko Sasagawa, is already seeing someone. Unbeknownst to him however, the blood of Giotto, the great Vongola the First, runs through his veins. Enter home tutor Reborn, an infant who claims to be the world's greatest hitman. Under orders from Vongola the Ninth, Reborn has come to train Tsuna to become a worthy successor to the famous Vongola Famiglia name. Tsuna, however, refuses, and claims that he will never become a mafia boss. How will the world's greatest hitman react to such opposition? Will he force Tsuna to adhere? Or will he use this unwillingness to his advantage? This is a story of a reluctant successor as he takes on the responsibilities of becoming the underworld's next ruling mafia leader, with the help of his friends and a one-of-a-kind home tutor.

            "synopsis": "Randou Masashi is a brash karate star who strikes fear in everyone around him. But despite his intimidating presence, he is secretly in love with the sweet and beautiful Rina Kurimi. Unfortunately, Randou is involved in a horrific bus accident, which leaves him comatose and with a disfigured face. A year later, he awakes to discover something utterly shocking—his face now resembles Rina's! Randou learns that he has been under the care of a surgeon named Jun Manabe, who reconstructed Randou's face based on a picture he had of Rina. Moreover, Randou is presumed dead, and his parents have moved away as a result. Distraught, Randou crosses paths with Rina and is mistaken for her twin sister Yuna, who fled from her house two years ago. Although Randou initially wished to restore his face, seeing Rina elated makes him reconsider his decision. However, a boy disguising himself as a girl is as absurd as it sounds, and being surrounded by troublesome individuals only makes it more difficult. Nevertheless, Randou is adamant about concealing his identity until he finds the real Yuna. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
