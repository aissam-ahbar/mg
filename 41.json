            "synopsis": "Kenzou Tenma, a renowned Japanese neurosurgeon working in post-war Germany, faces a difficult choice: to operate on Johan Liebert, an orphan boy on the verge of death, or on the mayor of Düsseldorf. In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead. As a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement. Disgraced and shunned by his colleagues, Tenma loses all hope of a successful career—that is, until the mysterious killing of Heinemann gives him another chance. Nine years later, Tenma is the head of the surgical department and close to becoming the director himself. Although all seems well for him at first, he soon becomes entangled in a chain of gruesome murders that have taken place throughout Germany. The culprit is a monster—the same one that Tenma saved on that fateful day nine years ago. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings. Setting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.

Kenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop. Kenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.

The series' combined storyline won the Grand Prize at the 37th Japan Cartoonist Awards on May 9, 2008. VIZ Media published the series in English under the VIZ Signature imprint from February 17, 2009 to September 18, 2012. VIZ Media licensed the series in 2005; however, at Urasawa's request, it was rescheduled for release after Monster finished its English publication due to a change in art style over time. The series has also been published in Brazilian Portuguese by Panini Comics/Planet Manga since September 2012. The series was adapted into a trilogy of live-action films which released in Japan between August 30, 2008 and August 29, 2009.",

One day, he realizes that there is a mystic relationship between pi and the perfect breasts. He conducted research and did calculations to determine what the perfect breasts are but he needed more raw data. Yumeto used to be unpopular and ugly, but to further his quest, he shed blood, sweat and tears to change his appearance and style to that of a handsome young man. When Tamura Jun, a classmate that has been absent for the majority of the school year, returns, Yumeto realizes that she might have the perfect boobs that he has been searching for. But getting to them is going to be harder than he could possibly imagine. (Source: MU)",

Of these, the Seven Heroes halted the invasion to herald a time of prosperity while the four Lances of Betrayal were supposedly defeated. Two decades later, the Lances of Betrayal have reappeared and formed a bandit militia near the frontier fief Gormbark. A man with the black sword and a scar over his left eye slays an entire troop of that militia. He is identified as a boy, Kóinzell, and becomes as much an object of fear as of hope even as his own past, motivations, and purpose are a mystery to those he meets in his travel. (Source: MU)",

However, this little neighborhood has some surprises under its concrete—it's actually a portal to parallel universes. And when this section of the city is leveled, the portal is cracked wide open. Sasshi and Arumi soon find themselves being hurtled from one strange world to the next! Making matters even more surreal, is the fact that these worlds seem to spoof and mock popular movies, video games, manga and anime! (Source: TokyoPop)",

One day at the train station, he meets a beautiful girl wearing a kimono, who has plans to visit someone but is struggling with directions. Kaoru decides to help her find her way; however, upon arrival at the location, they find an empty plot of land. While searching for any outstanding clues, the girl shows Kaoru a photo of the person she is looking for. As destiny would have it, Kaoru immediately recognizes the individual as himself with his childhood friend—the previously betrothed Aoi Sakuraba from the esteemed Sakuraba family—who is now sitting across from him. Their wedding was canceled many years prior after Kaoru left the highly regarded Hanabishi clan for personal reasons. Despite their time apart, Aoi remains committed to Kaoru. With this fateful encounter, Kaoru and Aoi are reunited, though they must keep their relationship a secret to preserve the reputation of the Sakuraba family. This is only complicated by the different women that Kaoru finds himself surrounded by. Even so, Kaoru and Aoi wish to learn more about each other and stay together against their families' wishes.

It has been over one thousand years since the Crisis of Systems (Lost Property), which resulted in the destruction of four planetary systems, leaving only a single inhabitable planet, Zion. Mankind is forced to live in space colonies, since that one planet is constantly being invaded by alien life forms that have come to be known as Victim. To stop the aliens and to allow people to land on Zion, mankind has developed the astronomical humanoid weapons, Ingrids, also known as Goddesses. G.O.A. (Goddess Operation Academy) is a school dedicated to the training of young men to pilot these Ingrids... (Source: Tokyopop)",

            "synopsis": "The legendary dollmaker Rozen created several unique dolls throughout his life, but it was not the materials he used that made them special. Known as Rozen Maidens, each doll was imbued with a Rosa Mystica—a precious gem that gives them life. But these dolls have a specific purpose: they must fight each other in a contest called the Alice Game. The winner becomes Alice, the perfect girl who will have the chance to meet their father and creator. Jun Sakurada, a middle school shut-in, experiences the Alice Game up close and personal when one of these dolls arrives at his house. After winding her up with the spring provided, she comes to life and introduces herself as Shinku, the fifth Rozen Maiden. Despite Jun quickly becoming annoyed by her haughty attitude, they find themselves working together when they are attacked by another doll. At Shinku's behest, Jun becomes her medium, allowing her to use his life force as a power to defeat their enemies. In the aftermath of the fight, more Rozen Maidens appear and decide to live at Jun's house. But can there be any peace when their very existence means they must fight each other?

            "synopsis": "After enduring four years of high school, Hideki Motosuwa strives to get into the university of his choice by attending cram school in Tokyo. Concurrently, he works daily shifts at a bar to make ends meet, thus missing out on the world's latest invention—human-like computers called Persocoms. Longing for a persocom of his own, Hideki is met with a stroke of luck when he stumbles upon a cute abandoned persocom in a garbage pile. Upon finding the power button, Hideki finds his newfound robot to be faulty and only capable of uttering the word \"Chii\"—which Hideki decides to name her after. Chii, however, is no ordinary persocom: capable of thinking and learning on her own, she is a legendary type of robot known as a \"Chobit.\" Now, it is up to Hideki to teach Chii how to live an ordinary life and to uncover the truth behind the elusive chobits series.

From turning a tiny scrap into a lethal throwing dagger to making a single sheet hard enough to block bullets, she's only limited by her imagination. She uses her phenomenal power to seek out legendary books containing secret information that, in the wrong hands, could be dangerous. Backed by a Special Operations Division in England, Yomiko has her hands full battling evildoers, saving the world, and trying to find time to curl up with a good book. (Source: VIZ Media)",

Initially believing to be on a graduation trip, Shuuya Nanahara and the rest of Shiroiwa Junior High's Class B find that they have been chosen to participate in this game of life and death known as The Program. Waking up to the realization that they have been quarantined on an island, the 42 students discover they have been fitted with metal collars which will detonate if certain conditions are not met. In order to obtain freedom, they must slaughter everyone else by whatever means necessary, and the last one standing is deemed the winner. As each member of the class heads down their own path, Shuuya makes it his goal to get off the island without playing the game in order to put an end to this madness once and for all.

            "background": "Battle Royale is an adaptation of Koushun Takami's novel of the same name which was published in April 1999 (and later published in English by VIZ Media). The novel was adapted into a live-action film the following year and became one of Japan's highest grossing films, though it was condemned by the National Diet. The series was published in English by Tokyopop from May 13, 2003 to April 11, 2006. The Tokyopop version was extensively rewritten by Keith Giffen which eventually led to contradictions and plot holes in the later volumes. Tokyopop rereleased the series in 5 omnibus volumes under the name Battle Royale: Ultimate Edition from October 16, 2007 to February 10, 2009. It was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Conrad from November 2006 to November 2011 and in Polish by Waneko since March 2012 to March 4, 2015.",

In this dystopia, only a strange young man known as Killy is brave enough to traverse its unforgiving territories. Possessing superhuman strength and a rare Graviton Beam Emitter, Killy fights off bloodthirsty beasts and other fiendish forces in his desperate search for a human with the Net Terminal Gene—genetic information that holds the potential to restore the corrupt world. The dark world of Blame! follows Killy as he meets new people, sheds more blood, and draws closer to finding the Net Terminal Gene. Through these exploits, the true nature of the world is slowly pieced together. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "The Kouga Manjidani and the Iga Tsubagakure ninja clans have been sworn enemies for centuries, with only the Hanzo Hattori truce maintaining a tenuous peace between the two families. But years later, when former shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa faces a dispute to determine which of his two grandsons shall succeed their father, he decides to settle the matter through a proxy war. Selected to represent the respective candidates, the Kouga and Iga send 10 of their best fighters into a deadly battle, with the winning party deciding the rightful successor. Thus, the truce is revoked and the ruthless bloodshed begins. But not all approve the truce's end. Gennosuke of Kouga and Oboro of Iga were to be married in hopes of ensuring lasting peace. However, unlike typical arranged marriages, they were already deeply in love. As preparations for the war ensue, Gennosuke questions his loyalties while Oboro refuses to fight. Fueled by their reawakened feud, will the two clans be consumed by hatred, or have their destinies changed by genuine love? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One of them is the England-based Hellsing, run by its cunning leader, Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing. Her greatest hunter, and trump card, is Alucard, an unbeatable vampire genetically modified by her father. Despite him being one of \"them,\" he swore to be her protector and servant. A new crisis begins and with the help of Seras Victoria, his recently turned vampire partner, Alucard has to uncover the truth behind the mysterious vampire attacks. Not every human is bound to be his ally in this battle, and he will not hesitate to kill anyone who stands in his way. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "In the year 2068, the Brain Computer, created by humans to be the core of a machine-driven Earth, itself creates Leave, an android that far surpasses the abilities of humans. With mankind now an unnecessary aspect of the Earth ecosystem, Leave, along with her 'father' Fenrir (the human scientist who raised her), destroys humanity and in its stead creates the four 'Mothers' who in turn create an android race modeled on Leave known as the Selenoid. They divide the world into four parts, each ruled by a Mother, and then further sub-divide the android population into hierarchical levels with the strong at the top and the weak at the bottom. A virtually perfect society... And it would have remained perfect if some of the surviving humans hadn't formed a revolutionary group together with some of the lower caste Selenoid with the explicit purpose of overthrowing Leave and delivering the Earth back into the hands of the humans.

Ryousuke will live to be at least two centuries old and possesses strange mental powers: He can enter people's minds, discover their darkest secrets, even rearrange their memories so that complete strangers will treat him like family. Ryousuke acts not out of malice but for survival-wandering Tokyo for reasons known only to him. No one recognizes him for what he is...until Dr. Mine Kujyou, a determined researcher, meets someone who challenges everything she knows about science-ES, possessor of the Eternal Sabbath gene.

But even as Cagalli and Athrun visit Chairman Durandal to cement the tentative cease-fire, Zaft terrorists plot with Neo Roanoke to drag both sides into all-out war. The plan: storm Zaft territory and steal several Gundam Mobile Suits. But that's only the beginning. They're also scheming to engineer a catastrophic event, one designed to drive the Earth down a bloody path. Now the crew of the Minerva must prevent disaster, as everything and everyone-including the love between Athrun and Cagalli-is thrown in mortal danger. (Source: Del Rey)",

            "synopsis": "Sealed in ancient jewels are the spirits of the heroes who tried and failed to unite China in the Three Kingdoms era. These jewels have been scattered throughout Japan, and have the power to draw out the full potential of those who inherit them. However, those owners, known as Toushi, are possessed with an insatiable appetite for battle. Hakufu Sonsaku is one such Toushi. Living in the country, Hakufu's desire to beat something to a pulp goes unfulfilled until her mother tells her to go to Tokyo, where she starts training with other Toushi and sets foot on the path to her destiny.

            "synopsis": "There is said to be a legendary \"Ghost of Akina\" that holds the fastest time to descend the Akina Pass. No one has ever come close to beating the record, nor has the mysterious driver of the white Toyota AE86 ever revealed themselves. Nowadays, the same AE86 can be seen every morning driving up and down the pass, making trips to a hotel residing at the top of the mountain. Unlike his classmates and coworkers, Takumi Fujiwara did not like cars. Any conversation about them would remind him of his early morning routine of delivering tofu for his father. He did not see the appeal in street racing and knew nothing about its rules or its culture. However, when tagging along to a nighttime meetup, the appearance of a rival racing team at the Akina Pass compels Takumi to hop behind the wheel of his father's AE86 and race them down the familiar mountain. This spur-of-the-moment decision marks the beginning of Takumi's high-octane journey, shifting from his daily deliveries to becoming the greatest drift racer ever. Along the way, he slowly finds and kindles his love for street racing as he comes face-to-face with a plethora of opponents, each ready to take on the renowned Ghost of Akina.
