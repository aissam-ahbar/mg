            "synopsis": "Guts, a former mercenary now known as the \"Black Swordsman,\" is out for revenge. After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings. Setting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.

When a mysterious man attempts to monopolize Sakura's ability, her memories scatter throughout different worlds in the form of feathers. To save Sakura, Syaoran seeks help from the Dimensional Witch and meets two other travelers—Kurogane and Fai D. Flourite. Kurogane, a capable fighter and ninja, has been banished from his homeworld and wishes to return. In contrast, Fai, a magician from Celes, wants to traverse different worlds to avoid his home and past. As the price to cross dimensions, each of the three must sacrifice their most valued possession. For Sakura's sake, Syaoran agrees to give away their relationship as payment to the Dimensional Witch. And with firm determination, Syaoran, Kurogane, and Fai begin journeying through numerous worlds to fight against their ill-fated destinies. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Whenever Naruto Uzumaki proclaims that he will someday become the Hokage—a title bestowed upon the best ninja in the Village Hidden in the Leaves—no one takes him seriously. Since birth, Naruto has been shunned and ridiculed by his fellow villagers. But their contempt isn't because Naruto is loud-mouthed, mischievous, or because of his ineptitude in the ninja arts, but because there is a demon inside him. Prior to Naruto's birth, the powerful and deadly Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village. In order to stop the rampage, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the demon inside the body of the newborn Naruto. And so when he is assigned to Team 7—along with his new teammates Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, under the mentorship of veteran ninja Kakashi Hatake—Naruto is forced to work together with other people for the first time in his life. Through undergoing vigorous training and taking on challenging missions, Naruto must learn what it means to work in a team and carve his own route toward becoming a full-fledged ninja recognized by his village.

            "synopsis": "For as long as he can remember, high school student Ichigo Kurosaki has been able to see the spirits of the dead, but that has not stopped him from leading an ordinary life. One day, Ichigo returns home to find an intruder in his room who introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper tasked with helping souls pass over. Suddenly, the two are jolted from their conversation when a Hollow—an evil spirit known for consuming souls—attacks. As Ichigo makes a brash attempt to stop the Hollow, Rukia steps in and shields him from a counterattack. Injured and unable to keep fighting, Rukia suggests a risky plan—transfer half of her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo. He accepts and, to Rukia's surprise, ends up absorbing her powers entirely, allowing him to easily dispatch the Hollow. Now a Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo must take up Rukia's duties of exterminating Hollows and protecting spirits, both living and dead. Along with his friends Orihime Inoue and Yasutora Sado—who later discover spiritual abilities of their own—Ichigo soon learns that the consequences of becoming a Soul Reaper and dealing with the world of spirits are far greater than he ever imagined.

            "synopsis": "Gol D. Roger, a man referred to as the \"King of the Pirates,\" is set to be executed by the World Government. But just before his demise, he confirms the existence of a great treasure, One Piece, located somewhere within the vast ocean known as the Grand Line. Announcing that One Piece can be claimed by anyone worthy enough to reach it, the King of the Pirates is executed and the Great Age of Pirates begins. Twenty-two years later, a young man by the name of Monkey D. Luffy is ready to embark on his own adventure, searching for One Piece and striving to become the new King of the Pirates. Armed with just a straw hat, a small boat, and an elastic body, he sets out on a fantastic journey to gather his own crew and a worthy ship that will take them across the Grand Line to claim the greatest status on the high seas.

To reach his latter goal, he is assigned one last task: to teach English at a middle school in Japan. Much to his surprise and dismay, he not only discovers that his homeroom class consists of 31 girls, but also ends up revealing his true identity as a magician to Asuna Kagurazaka, one of his new students. Negi must now negotiate with the girl and face his most difficult challenge yet—to keep his identity a secret as he tackles magical threats both from within and outside of Mahora Academy, all the while keeping a watchful eye out for his lost father.

            "synopsis": "Ten years have passed since the end of Bakumatsu, an era of war that saw the uprising of citizens against the Tokugawa shogunate. The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money. One wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past. Now in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?

            "synopsis": "Soun Tendou runs the Tendou Martial Arts School accompanied by his three daughters: Akane, Nabiki, and Kasumi. One day, the sisters' lives are turned upside down when their father announces that he has promised one of them to be married to a fellow martial artist's son in hopes of carrying on the family legacy. In addition to their mixed reactions, when the fiancé arrives, the last thing the Tendou family expects is Ranma Saotome and his father, Genma. Ranma has been training in China with his father until an unfortunate accident changed them both. Now, when water touches them, Ranma turns into a girl and Genma into a giant panda. Ranma ½ follows Ranma as he attempts to get along with his newly betrothed, the youngest of the Tendou sisters, Akane. As the two begin to attend the same school, they deal with fellow friends and rivals, all of whom have something to say about their engagement. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Thousands of years ago, there existed those gifted with the power of God. Their mission: to destroy the ominous evils that lurk in the darkness known as \"Akuma.\" Led by the Milenium Earl, Akuma seek to destroy fragments of \"Innocence,\" the only weapons capable of harming the Earl and his army and bring about the Great Flood from a hundred years ago. To prevent this tragedy from happening, the Black Order was formed as an organization dedicated to fighting the Earl. They recruit Exorcists, those with the inherent ability to accomodate Innocence, to fight against the Akuma. In the late 19th century, Allen Walker—a white-haired boy armed with Innocence that takes the form of his entire left arm and a cursed eye that can see Akuma—is sent to the Black Order. There, Allen meets various comrades from the Order—the mercurial Yuu Kanda, the kindhearted Lenalee Lee, and the cheerful yet mysterious Lavi. Despite their different personalities, they have one goal in mind: to bring salvation to the souls of Akuma and prevent the Earl from destroying the world. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Alchemists are knowledgeable and naturally talented individuals who can manipulate and modify matter due to their art. Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor. Years later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Six years ago, Kamui Shirou and siblings Fuuma and Kotori Monou were inseparable childhood friends. After the sudden, gruesome death of the Monou siblings' mother, Kamui was taken away from Tokyo by his own mother. In the years that passed, the two lived peacefully while Kamui strengthened his innate telekinetic abilities. When his mother passes away in 1999, her dying wish prompts him to return to Tokyo to face his \"destiny.\" When Kamui reappears in the city, his attitude has taken a drastic turn, and he displays the growth of his powers through violent confrontations in the streets. Various opponents come after him asking if he is \"Kamui,\" but they seem to be demanding something far more significant than his name. These fighters represent two opposite factions—the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth—who each wish to recruit him to their cause. Piecing together clues about the apocalyptic \"promised day,\" Kamui realizes that he holds the fate of the world in his hands. Depending on which group of Dragons he allies himself with, he can either choose to save the world—or end it. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
            "background": "X is written and illustrated by the four-person team of CLAMP. It is currently incomplete, but CLAMP has stated their intention to one day conclude the series if they can. It started serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka shoujo manga magazine in May 1992 and stopped serialization in March 2003. Events depicted in the manga were too similar for comfort to real-life disasters that occurred in Japan, which contributed to the series' halt. Chapters of X have been collected in eighteen and a \"half\" volumes, out of a total twenty-one volumes expected. X has been adapted into various anime that speculate about events that occurred before the manga started or after the point where the manga left off. The series was published in English by VIZ Media as 3-in-1 omnibus volume from November 8, 2011 to August 13, 2013.",

It takes a special kind of person to unlock the full potential of these remnants from the past, and a unique breed of humans known as O.P.T.s (or O-Parts Tacticians) become a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, O-Parts can be used for good or evil purposes. Jio is a young boy with a tragic past who only trusts one thing in the world: money. Little does he suspect that he is actually a very powerful O.P.T., and inside him sleeps a demon of incredible ferocity. He meets up with a girl named Ruby, and together they decide to embark on a dangerous quest to discover as many O-Parts as they can. Will Jio help Ruby realize her dream of becoming a world famous treasure hunter? More importantly, will Ruby help Jio realize his dream of--world domination?!

Hidden inside the paintings Maron steals are demons sent by the demon lord, who plans to weaken God's power by having his minions possess human hearts. Assisted by the minor angel Finn Fish, it is up to Maron as the reincarnation of Jeanne d'Arc to assume her alter ego, hunt down the cursed paintings, and seal the vile demons away. However, the tough job of balancing this duty with her lonesome high school life only proves more challenging when a mysterious new phantom thief makes his appearance—Kaitou Sinbad.

He searches endlessly for a mythical set of 12 Rings of the Dead—jewelry said to give life to the possessor. These rings are hunted by mercenaries and outlaws alike for a wide variety of reasons, but Gamma seeks to grant himself eternal life by possessing all 12. Gamma comes across teenager John Elwood Shepherd in his travels, who decides to follow Gamma after a brutal fight claims the life of his sister. Elwood seeks to use the Rings of the Dead to bring his sister back to life and quickly develops an admiration for Gamma, whose combat prowess saves Elwood's life time after time. Along the way, the two travelers encounter new friends and old allies from Gamma's past, working with them to defeat enemies who seek to use the Rings of the Dead for their own nefarious purposes.

            "synopsis": "Busou Renkin is the story of the teenager Kazuki Mutou, who dies trying to save a girl who was being attacked by an eerie monster. The next morning, however, Kazuki is left wondering whether it was all a dream. Lo and behold, the girl, the monster, and his death are all real! The girl, Tokiko Tsumura, was actually trying to slay the homunculus (a beast that can take the form of humans, but whose main source of food is people), but Kazuki got in her way. To revive Kazuki, Tokiko replaces his heart with a \"kakugane,\" an alchemic device that allows him to summon a lance with which to fight the monsters. It turns out that Tokiko is a member of Renkin Kenshi (Alchemist Soldiers)—an organization sworn to protect the world from the diabolical creatures. Soon, Kazuki joins Tokiko in her quest to terminate the sinister being that creates and controls the homunculus. (Source: VIZ Media) Included one-shot: Volume 10: Embalming: Dead Body and Bride",

            "synopsis": "Bulma, a headstrong 16-year-old girl, is on a quest to find the mythical Dragon Balls—seven scattered magic orbs that grant the finder a single wish. She has but one desire in mind: a perfect boyfriend. On her journey, Bulma stumbles upon Gokuu Son, a powerful orphan who has only ever known one human besides her. Gokuu possesses one of the Dragon Balls, it being a memento from his late grandfather. In exchange for it, Bulma invites Gokuu to be a companion in her travels. By Bulma's side, Gokuu discovers a world completely alien to him. Powerful enemies embark on their own pursuits of the Dragon Balls, pushing Gokuu beyond his limits in order to protect Bulma and their growing circle of allies. However, Gokuu has secrets unbeknownst to even himself; the incredible strength within him stems from a mysterious source, one that threatens the many people he grows to hold dear. As his prowess in martial arts flourishes, Gokuu attracts stronger opponents whose villainous plans could collapse beneath his might. He undertakes the endless venture of combat training to defend his loved ones and the fate of the planet itself. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
            "background": "Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga series of all time, with over 230 million copies sold worldwide with 157 million in Japan alone, making it the third all-time best selling manga as of 2015, and the #1 manga series not currently publishing. The series is often credited for the \"Golden Age of Jump\" where the magazine's circulation was at its highest. VIZ Media serialized the manga in English from March 1998 to March 2005 in monthly comic book anthology format; and was later collected into traditional tankobon format volumes from March 12, 2003 to June 6, 2006. To closer follow the English anime localization, the series is split; in which volumes 17-42 are titled Dragon Ball Z and renumbered as volumes 1-26. Other releases by VIZ include the large format VIZ Big Edition, kanzenban cover based 3-in-1 Edition, and a Full Color Edition of chapters 195-245. Other English publishers include Madman Entertainment in Australia/New Zealand, and the now defunct Gollancz Manga (distribution rights transferred to VIZ) in the United Kingdom. The series is also published in Spanish by Planet DeAgostini Cómics and in French by Glénat Editions.",

            "synopsis": "During the Edo period, Japan is suddenly invaded by alien creatures known as the \"Amanto.\" Despite the samurai's attempts to combat the extraterrestrial menace, the Shogun soon realizes that their efforts are futile and decides to surrender. This marks the beginning of an uneasy agreement between the Shogunate and Amanto, one that results in a countrywide sword ban and the disappearance of the samurai spirit. However, there exists one eccentric individual who wields a wooden sword and refuses to let his samurai status die. Now that his kind are no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet. Joined by his self-proclaimed disciple Shinpachi Shimura, the fearsome alien Kagura, and a giant dog named Sadaharu, they run the business known as Yorozuya, often getting caught up in all sorts of crazy and hilarious shenanigans. [Written by MAL Rewrite] Included one-shots: Volume 1: Dandelion Volume 2: Shirokuro (Black and White) Volume 24: 13 Volume 38: Bankara-san ga Tooru",

Terrible grades, horrible fitness, and a non-existent social life means he has no reason to attend school, especially after discovering that his crush, Kyouko Sasagawa, is already seeing someone. Unbeknownst to him however, the blood of Giotto, the great Vongola the First, runs through his veins. Enter home tutor Reborn, an infant who claims to be the world's greatest hitman. Under orders from Vongola the Ninth, Reborn has come to train Tsuna to become a worthy successor to the famous Vongola Famiglia name. Tsuna, however, refuses, and claims that he will never become a mafia boss. How will the world's greatest hitman react to such opposition? Will he force Tsuna to adhere? Or will he use this unwillingness to his advantage? This is a story of a reluctant successor as he takes on the responsibilities of becoming the underworld's next ruling mafia leader, with the help of his friends and a one-of-a-kind home tutor.

            "synopsis": "Shamans are extraordinary individuals with the ability to communicate with ghosts, spirits, and gods, which are invisible to ordinary people. The Shaman Fight—a prestigious tournament pitting shamans from all over the world against each other—is held every five hundred years, where the winner is crowned Shaman King. This title allows the current incumbent to call upon the Great Spirit and shape the world as they see fit. Finding himself late for class one night, Manta Oyamada, an ordinary middle school student, decides to take a shortcut through the local cemetery. Noticing him, a lone boy sitting on a gravestone invites Manta to stargaze with \"them.\" Realizing that \"them\" refers to the boy and his ghostly friends, Manta flees in terror. Later, the boy introduces himself as You Asakura, a Shaman-in-training, and demonstrates his powers by teaming up with the ghost of six-hundred-year-old samurai Amidamaru to save Manta from a group of thugs. You befriends Manta due to his ability to see spirits, and with the help of Amidamaru, they set out to accomplish You's goal of becoming the next Shaman King.

            "synopsis": "Fourteen-year-old thug Yuusuke Urameshi spends his days skipping school and causing trouble for the adults in his life. Yuusuke regularly engages in street brawls against rival Kazuma Kuwabara and ridicules his childhood friend Keiko Yukimura. Filled with self-loathing and the burden of an alcoholic mother, Yuusuke sacrifices it all in a split-second decision—he tackles a small child out of the way of an oncoming car, losing his life in the process. Spirit guide Botan intervenes, allowing Yuusuke to see how the people in his life react to his death; he is moved by the emotional ruin his loss causes his mother, Keiko, and even Kuwabara. Additionally, due to his death's heroic nature, he receives an opportunity to return to life from the Spirit World ruler's son, Koenma. Koenma hires Yuusuke as a \"Spirit Detective\" and tasks him with solving a series of increasingly challenging paranormal mysteries. Battling and befriending demons such as the beautiful Kurama and hostile Hiei, Yuusuke further develops and utilizes his skills as a fighter. But as dark forces move in the Underworld, Yuusuke struggles alongside his companions to defend everything he took for granted. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "High school student Yuugi Mutou spends his days being bullied between classes and his nights playing board games and solving puzzles in his bedroom. Yuugi's penchant for gameplay comes from his grandfather, whose game shop also serves as a house for the two. One night, Yuugi manages to solve the Millennium Puzzle, a seemingly impossible challenge that awakens his inner darkness and converts it into an alternate persona: Yami Yuugi. Transforming into the more bold and dangerous persona against his will in moments of great distress, Yuugi begins to moonlight as a vengeful vigilante, challenging bullies and evil-doers to risky games where failure results in fates worse than death. Yuugi and his alter ego befriend some of the very students who once bullied him, forming unbreakable companionships with them. But the group must contend with villains far deadlier than the high school punks they originally rallied against, enemies who use games for nefarious purposes and threaten Yuugi and his friends' very lives.

Due to the fact she has not eaten since the start of her journey, she decided to just conclude the huge peach was a god sent and did the most logical thing anyone would have done—eat it. However, just as she had her first bite, a young male jumps out of the peach! And before Suzuri knows it, she's the 18th master to Momo who could do anything that Suzuri commands! What kind of danger would they encounter on their journey as they face a god that goes by the name Kyuui? And what dark secret does Momo have!? (Source: Sakura-Crisis)",

Of these, the Seven Heroes halted the invasion to herald a time of prosperity while the four Lances of Betrayal were supposedly defeated. Two decades later, the Lances of Betrayal have reappeared and formed a bandit militia near the frontier fief Gormbark. A man with the black sword and a scar over his left eye slays an entire troop of that militia. He is identified as a boy, Kóinzell, and becomes as much an object of fear as of hope even as his own past, motivations, and purpose are a mystery to those he meets in his travel. (Source: MU)",

He's the toughest kid at Higashi Junior High School, easy on the eyes but dangerously tough when he needs to be. Plus, Itsuki lives with the mysterious and sexy Noyamano sisters. Life is never dull, but it becomes dangerous when Itsuki leads his school to victory over some vindictive Westside punks with gangster connections. Now he stands to lose his school, his friends, and everything he cares about. But in his darkest hour, the Noyamano girls come to Itsuki's aid. They can teach him a powerful skill that will save their school from the gangsters' siege–and introduce Itsuki to a thrilling and terrifying new world. (Source: Del Rey)",

            "synopsis": "A seemingly ordinary modern day teenager, Yuri, is suddenly whisked away to the Hittite empire in ancient Anatolia, where an ambitious queen wants the girl for a blood sacrifice in order to murder all heirs but her son, thus seizing control of the throne. Luckily, the timely intervention of Prince Kail saves Yuri from the queen's grasp. Kail promises to send Yuri back to her home, but the queen's persistent schemes to kill them both, plus their growing feelings for each other, keep those plans delayed.

One day, she notices mysterious, ring-like markings around the necks of two of her classmates, Chika Akatsuki and Shito Tachibana — two boys who miraculously survived a horrible accident six months before. Michiru, possessing the rare ability to see these rings, knows that they warn of impending death.

They came seeking the King's Edel Raid, rumored to be one of the Shichikou-houju (Seven Glittering Jewels). Sensing their intent, the King hid his daughter with his Edel Raid and fought against the invasion but was defeated in battle that resulted in the desert kingdom being blanketed in a sheet of white snow. Escaping capture, the Crown Princess Achea Fuajarl XIV reacted with Jeen, the King's Edel Raid, and along with Puffe, the Kingdom's only mechanic, fled Fuajarl in an ancient tank. They are on a journey to restore the Kingdom and exact vengeance on the Garden of Eden. This story takes place two years after Erementar Gerad. (Source: MU)",

Though this blade is coveted by many, only the heirs to the House of Manas can wield it. But that doesn’t stop the sinister from trying. Ernan, once trusted knight of the House of Manas, murders his commander, robs him Brumhart and orders the death of Leon’s only son, Zian. But the men sent to perform this infanticide come up against a mysterious figure in a dark cloak who defeats them only to disappear with child into the thick of the Tass Forest. Sixteen years later, Ernan has become a feared tyrant, but still has not been able to unsheathe Brumhart. Thus begins the tale of this desperate king and the young boy who would be one.

He attempts to reunite with his brother Koutarou, who left Germany five years ago to study robotics at a university. Unfortunately, no sooner than his brother begins an exhibition about an advanced form of machine, he's kidnapped by a mecha in the shape of a wasp and a servant of the Machine Empire. Teppei starts a chase, using a gauntlet known as the \"Messiah Fist\" to hold onto the wasp as it travels to a secretive base in the Gobi Desert which serves as the Empire's headquarters. Getting thrown into a garbage heap and facing a cyborg he somehow is familiar with, Teppei's blood awakens a relic from the past; a kirin-type B't known only as \"X\" which, five years ago, was considered the most powerful B't in existence. Both are equally stubborn, although quite different in many ways, and after a few initial squabbles, X resolves to help Teppei in his quest to save his brother. (Source: TVTropes)",

But Ginta is a dreamer and has had the same dream 102 times, always in the same fantasy world, where he is a hero blessed with all the abilities he lacks in real life. One day, a supernatural figure appears at Ginta's school and summons him to a mysterious and exciting new world! In this strange universe filled with magic and wonder, he is strong, tough, agile—and he can see without his glasses! Thus, Ginta begins a mystical quest in search of the magical items known as \"ÄRMS,\" one of which may have the power to send him home. Joining him on this epic journey are his companion Jack and the valuable living, talking, mustachioed iron-ball weapon known as \"Babbo,\" which everyone wants but, it seems, only Ginta can possess!

Since then, ARMs have become a common thing, Guardians especially! Kai himself doesn't have one though, and dreams big of being able to get an ARM like Ginta's! When his caretaker, the old ARM-smith that took him in after his parents' deaths, sends him out on an errand, he is attacked by a bandit from \"chess\"! In his escape attempt, he finds more than he bargained for when he comes across Babbo! But, now with Babbo's awakening, the fake ARMs are going out of control! Is it Kai's turn to save MAR Heaven following in his hero's footsteps? (Source: Project Kurai Ryu)",

            "synopsis": "Often considered untrustworthy, Japanese ninja were in fact unwaveringly loyal to their masters. But in modern-day Japan, high school student and self-proclaimed ninja Rekka Hanabishi finds it difficult to carry on their legacy, that is, until he saves a cute girl named Yanagi Sakoshita from a group of delinquents. In the aftermath of the event, Rekka deems Yanagi worthy of being his master, swearing to protect her. As a sign of their trust, the two reveal their most valuable secrets to each other: Yanagi can quickly heal wounds, while Rekka can create fire with just a snap of his fingers. However, their dazzling exchange does not go unnoticed as a mysterious woman called Kage Houshi appears. She somehow knows about their powers and threatens them, claiming Rekka must be returned, for he is the only one who can kill her. The pair hold their ground, but before things can escalate any further, Kage Houshi calmly leaves. Thinking the crisis is over, Rekka and Yanagi continue their daily lives, unaware that they are about to be dragged into a centuries-long ninja conspiracy with the lives of their friends and their own on the line.

Kick the butts of the toughest guys in school, prove himself to be the baddest dude around, and run the whole shebang. Problem is, it's his butt that gets kicked that first day. Completely humiliated, Mokichi joins the Wrestling Club in hopes of learning to fight. There he meets unlikely allies, Tamako and Higuchi, two of the hottest battle babes to ever roll their sweaty bods over Swan Academy's gym mats. And Mokichi's gonna need all the friends he can get, what with the likes of the Karate Club looking to \"break in\" the new kid in the worst way possible. (Source: Tokyopop)",

Initially believing to be on a graduation trip, Shuuya Nanahara and the rest of Shiroiwa Junior High's Class B find that they have been chosen to participate in this game of life and death known as The Program. Waking up to the realization that they have been quarantined on an island, the 42 students discover they have been fitted with metal collars which will detonate if certain conditions are not met. In order to obtain freedom, they must slaughter everyone else by whatever means necessary, and the last one standing is deemed the winner. As each member of the class heads down their own path, Shuuya makes it his goal to get off the island without playing the game in order to put an end to this madness once and for all.

            "background": "Battle Royale is an adaptation of Koushun Takami's novel of the same name which was published in April 1999 (and later published in English by VIZ Media). The novel was adapted into a live-action film the following year and became one of Japan's highest grossing films, though it was condemned by the National Diet. The series was published in English by Tokyopop from May 13, 2003 to April 11, 2006. The Tokyopop version was extensively rewritten by Keith Giffen which eventually led to contradictions and plot holes in the later volumes. Tokyopop rereleased the series in 5 omnibus volumes under the name Battle Royale: Ultimate Edition from October 16, 2007 to February 10, 2009. It was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Conrad from November 2006 to November 2011 and in Polish by Waneko since March 2012 to March 4, 2015.",

The dark world of Blame! follows Killy as he meets new people, sheds more blood, and draws closer to finding the Net Terminal Gene. Through these exploits, the true nature of the world is slowly pieced together. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",
