            "synopsis": "Aoyagi Ritsuka is one troubled 6th grader. Two years ago, he mysteriously lost his memory and developed an alternate personality. His mother constantly berates (and occasionally beats) him, asking what happened to the \"real\" Ritsuka, and his only defender and friend, his older brother Seimei, was recently killed. Suddenly, Seimei's apparent \"friend,\" Soubi, appears. Soubi tells him that Ritsuka's true name is \"Loveless,\" and that Soubi was assigned by Seimei to take care of Ritsuka and protect him. Ritsuka soon gets sucked into a bizzare underground society where teams of people, a \"Fighter Unit,\" and a \"Sacrifice,\" battle using elaborate and beautifully-phrased spells. He seeks both acceptance of himself, and the answer to the mystery of who killed his brother and why. (Source: TokyoPop)",

            "synopsis": "High school student Tasuku Mizuochi has a secret he knows and a secret he doesn't. Even though he punches, kicks, and otherwise abuses fellow karate team member, Ryouta, on a daily basis, Tasuku has hidden feelings for his childhood friend. When Tasuku's mother died, Ryouta was always there to comfort him, and these emotions grew over time to become something else. Confused and embarrassed by his secret crush, Tasuku takes his frustrations out on Ryouta to keep him from ever knowing the truth. When Tasuku learns that his late mother may have been an \"ageman\" (ah-gay-man)--a woman who brings men good fortune—he starts to believe he's inherited these powers, too. Can having the ability to influence luck give Tasuku and Ryouta a future together? Or will all the people crawling out of the woodwork wanting to use Tasuku's power cause him to run screaming for the hills?! (Source: DokiDoki)",

Works of art come from the deepest depths of an artist’s soul, so how can anyone else be expressing themselves so much like Takashiro? Filled with a yearning to find his artistic soulmate, Takashiro goes off to art school in Tokyo and meets classmate Sakae Fujiwara. Soon, Takashiro learns that this is the artist he’s been searching for – the one who created a Color so much like his own – but Sakae is a guy! Can such a profound connection between two people transcend gender and become something more? (Source: Dokidoki)",

There's a strange symbol on his palm, testimony to what his is. Inaba and Yukia are two of the Kira's closest friends. However, because he is a special type of his species, Kira is wanted by others for the power he can bring. The mysterious Rosen Kroitz Secret Society seems to know a great deal about the Saramanda, keeping them as pets and breeding them. One day, Kira is captured by his pursuers, and Inaba and Yukia chase after the car he's trapped in. The accident that follows changes everything for the friends, as does the appearance of Kira's older brother... (Source: Storm in Heaven)",

Tatsuki is in fact the successor to Ryuu-Ou, the dragon king, and possesses the power of the Nyoi-Houshu, a magical dagger. Oota is a Zashiki Warashi, a protective house-spirit without a home, and is also Tatsuki's subservient lover. When their human classmate, Kouhei Misaki, accidentally witnesses the two having sex, he mistakenly believes that Tatsuki is forcing the quiet Oota into it, and he resolves to break the two apart.

When a scruffy photographer by the name of Kaoru Nakahara has a premonition of love (or so he says) and takes a campus photography job, he ends up meeting Akira and falls head over heels. Will Akira learn to love the persistent pervert, or will he cling to his beloved brother? (Source: Juné Manga)",

When a scruffy photographer by the name of Kaoru Nakahara has a premonition of love (or so he says) and takes a campus photography job, he ends up meeting Akira and falls head over heels. Will Akira learn to love the persistent pervert, or will he cling to his beloved brother? (Source: Juné Manga)",

Ten years later, after a string of failed jobs and relationships, his friend Chika finally convinces him to get back into boxing. But where Sohei was once champ material, he is now 25 years old (over the hill in boxing years) and must play catch up with all the 18-year-olds at the gym. To make things worse, Chika’s been secretly in love with Sohei for years, and has about had it with waiting for Sohei to figure it out. With his upcoming pro test, his squabbles with the youngsters in the boxing club, and Chika’s increasingly bold advances, will Sohei finally find some direction and happiness in his life?

            "synopsis": "Tooru is a shy and quiet student who has developed a special crush on his close friend Ryouji, the most popular member of the high school swim team. In front of Ryouji, Tooru hides his feelings and acts as if he is just one of Ryouji's good friends, but in a moment out of the blue his world will be turned upside down as Ryouji will confess a secret desire for Tooru. Dazzled, Tooru can barely hide his excitement for Ryouji and quickly accepts his offer. As time passes, Tooru's happiness begins to fade knowing that his affair with Ryouji was just a fling based out of Ryouji's sexual curiosity. Tooru, adamant about his feelings for Ryouji, confides in another one of his close friend, Kashiwazaki, about his dilemma. The two set off to devise a plan to test Ryouji's true intentions by faking a romantic relationship. Soon after, a frustrated and jealous Ryouji attempts to pry Tooru out of the arms of Kashiwazaki. Is it just as they planned? Yeah! That is of course until Tooru realizes Kashiwazaki wasn't really faking! How could he not have seen it coming? Both Tooru and Ryouji have hidden their feelings from each other in the past, but now they have discovered that they were not the only ones. Will Tooru and Ryouji be reunited or will their true feelings for each other go unfulfilled? (Source: DMP)",

            "synopsis": "The new school year is here! Fujimori Academy students Kiriya Matsuoka and Tomoe Izumi have been chosen as this year’s princesses, but it’s going to take a lot of hard work to bring them up to speed. Enter former princesses Kouno, Shihoudani and Yutaka for a bit of princess training! Although Matsuoka and Izumi seem willing and able to take over the job of dressing up as girls and cheering at school events, they’re not exactly what you’d call “friends.” In fact, they seem to be about as opposite as two people can get. This animosity spells trouble for a student body that depends on their princesses to give them a warm, glowy feeling all year long. Can President Sakamoto and the ex-princesses convince Matsuoka and Izumi to bond for the sake of the school? Or will it take more than a common experience to bring two very different people together?

            "synopsis": "Atsushi Ikeda, a kindhearted college student, tends abandoned animals and brings them inside his home. When he spots an injured high school student with a violin lying at his doorstep, he does not think twice about taking him in for the night. The fierce young man, introducing himself as Riya Narukawa, has no idea why he was unconscious in front of Atsushi's door but worries no further, as he claims that memory lapses are a common occurrence. The following day, when Riya gets a sudden headache while playing the violin for Atsushi, he professes that he ran away from home because his dead brother's spirit inside him has been forcing him to play the violin. Stunned by the sudden revelation, a concerned Atsushi discovers that Riya is a prodigious violinist and the only son of a famous musician. Worried that things are not matching up, he soon learns that Riya has a multiple personality disorder, causing him to invent a deceased younger brother whom he believes to be within his soul. Carrying the weight of other people's expectations for his talent, Riya tries to come to terms with the underlying problems behind his psychological complications, all while understanding what Atsushi means to him.
