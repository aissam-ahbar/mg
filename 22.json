            "synopsis": "At the tender age of twelve, Mitsuki Kouyama has a sarcoma in her throat. Though this rare cancer can be cured by removing her vocal cords, Mitsuki refuses because of her desire to become a pop singer and keep her childhood promise to Eichi Sakurai, her first love who left for America. Unable to both heal and keep her voice, she allows her health to deteriorate as she accepts her tragic fate. One day, while escaping the home of her music-hating grandmother to attend an audition, Mitsuki meets two shinigami Takuto Kira and Meroko Yui. Realizing that Mitsuki can see them, Takuto and Meroko reveal to her that she will die in a year. Moved by her plight, Takuto allows Mitsuki the chance to pursue her dream by giving her the ability to transform into a healthy sixteen-year-old girl. After being chosen for a contract with Seed Records, Mitsuki makes her debut under the stage name Full Moon and chooses to pursue her dream music career before her life's end.

            "synopsis": "Negi Springfield, a 10-year-old wizard who recently graduated from Merdiana Magic Academy in Wales, hopes to achieve two things—to find his missing father, who was once known as the Thousand Master, and to become a Magister Magi, someone who helps the everyday world through magic. To reach his latter goal, he is assigned one last task: to teach English at a middle school in Japan. Much to his surprise and dismay, he not only discovers that his homeroom class consists of 31 girls, but also ends up revealing his true identity as a magician to Asuna Kagurazaka, one of his new students. Negi must now negotiate with the girl and face his most difficult challenge yet—to keep his identity a secret as he tackles magical threats both from within and outside of Mahora Academy, all the while keeping a watchful eye out for his lost father.

            "synopsis": "It is said that if a couple gets into the University of Tokyo together, they will live happily ever after. However, for Keitarou Urashima, UTokyo is a distant dream. After failing the entrance exams twice already, he decides to stay at his grandmother's inn in Tokyo in order to prepare for his third attempt. He is, therefore, surprised when he finds out that not only has his grandmother gone on a long vacation, but the inn has also become the Hinata House, an all-girls dormitory! Unfortunately for Keitarou, a series of misunderstandings during his first visit leave him with five untrusting tenants. But when Haruka Urashima, his aunt who works at the dorm, brings up that he is supposedly a UTokyo student, the girls' impressions of him quickly change, and they reluctantly allow him to stay. Feeling guilty about the lie, he slowly gets to know his new neighbors: the cute yet violent Naru Narusegawa, the cheeky and opportunistic Mitsune Konno, the soft-spoken Shinobu Maehara, the straight-laced Motoko Aoyama, and the mischievous Kaolla Su. Thus continues the unpopular Keitarou's difficult journey to get into UTokyo, all for the chance to fulfill his childhood promise to the only girl who has ever shown any interest in him and maybe, just maybe, meet her again...

            "synopsis": "Yukino Miyazawa is the perfect model student. Pretty, kind, good at sports, always at the top of her class. But she's not all that she seems. It's all an act of deception; she is really the self-confessed 'queen of vanity,' and her only goal in life is winning the praise and admiration of everyone around her. When she enters high school, she finally meets her match: Souichirou Arima, a handsome, athletic, popular, and very intelligent young boy. Ever since he stole the top seat in the class from her, Yukino has hated him, and has been plotting on how to take back her former place as the object of all other students' admiration. What she wasn't expecting, however, was that Souichirou, the very boy she hated, would confess his love for her. Or that he would find out about her deception—and use it to blackmail her! Together, they discover that they have more in common than they knew, and they slowly begin to bring out each other's inner selves.

Sana's outgoing and friendly nature leads her to work towards correcting all of the problems around her. Her 'meddling' irritates Hayama but at the same time captivates him, just as Hayama's gloomy nature irritates Sana and compels her to change him. As these two opposites attract each other, they face many hardships which bring them closer to a mutual understanding. (Source: ANN)",

One day, the sisters' lives are turned upside down when their father announces that he has promised one of them to be married to a fellow martial artist's son in hopes of carrying on the family legacy. In addition to their mixed reactions, when the fiancé arrives, the last thing the Tendou family expects is Ranma Saotome and his father, Genma. Ranma has been training in China with his father until an unfortunate accident changed them both. Now, when water touches them, Ranma turns into a girl and Genma into a giant panda. Ranma ½ follows Ranma as he attempts to get along with his newly betrothed, the youngest of the Tendou sisters, Akane. As the two begin to attend the same school, they deal with fellow friends and rivals, all of whom have something to say about their engagement. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Nana Komatsu is a naive, unmotivated girl who spends her high school days chasing one crush after the other. Despite continually facing failure in her quest for love, her spirits have never dampened. At the age of 20, she finds herself on a train to Tokyo with hopes of reuniting with her current boyfriend. Nana Osaki, on the other hand, is feisty and prideful. After joining a local band during her high school days, she falls in love with music and one of the band members. However, when faced with the choice between her relationship and her musical career, she chooses the latter and separates from her boyfriend. On her 20th birthday, she boards the same train to Tokyo, like her namesake, where she aims to become a top vocalist. The two girls with the same name but very different aspirations find themselves sitting together on their journey to the city, and, as fate would have it, eventually share the same apartment. A deep and unique bond is then forged, where they will support each other in this saga of love, music, friendship, and heartbreak. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "After two eccentrically dressed individuals ambush her, high school student Yukari Hayasaka promptly passes out due to shock. She soon awakens to find herself surrounded by even more strangely dressed people in the basement studio of Paradise Kiss—a fashion design club composed of four students from Yazawa School for the Arts. Although it seems like Yukari has been kidnapped, the older students explain that they only approached her to see if she would model their collection for an upcoming fashion show. Being a senior with a busy schedule, Yukari furiously rejects the group's offer. But when she drops her student passbook in her haste to leave, the ringleader of the group, George Koizumi, picks it up and uses it as a means to coerce Yukari into considering their request. After hearing about the other members' unbridled ambition, Yukari is inspired to reevaluate her own circumstances and eventually agrees to help them out. Now as Paradise Kiss' model, Yukari must learn to balance her new responsibilities with her hectic personal life. However, the more time she spends with George and the rest of the team, the harder it becomes for her to avoid getting swept up in the glitz and glamor of the fashion world.

            "synopsis": "At Ouran High School, an academy where only the children of the rich and powerful attend, there exists a club consisting of the most elite of the student body: the legendary Host Club. Within the club's room, six beautiful, bored boys spend their time entertaining equally beautiful and bored girls. Haruhi Fujioka, a poor scholarship student, has no interest in the Host Club—until she breaks a valuable vase in their clubroom. After being mistaken for a boy, Haruhi is forced by Kyouya Ootori to work for the Host Club to repay her debt. Tamaki Suou, the princely leader of the club, eagerly takes her under his wing to teach her the ways of the host. Things, however, are never quite so simple with the Host Club around. Even the most mundane events can turn into huge spectacles with the likes of prankster twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, stoic Takashi Morinozuka, and sweet Mitsukuni \"Hunny\" Haninozuka. The crazy adventures of the Host Club are just beginning, and Haruhi must learn how to survive in the glitzy world of the hosts. [Written by MAL Rewrite] Note: The final volume contains a special bonus chapter where the group travels to Spain.",

After all, she also has feelings for his friend. Unluckily, however, their respective crushes fall for each other instead. Determined to find new love after their recent misfortunes, the pair decide to cheer each other on while maintaining their usual dynamic of constant bickering. Although they continually deny it, Risa and Ootani are more similar than they like to admit: they both have unusual heights, failing grades, identical tastes in food, and a tendency to act extremely childish. Together, they inspire laughter among their peers as a so-called comedic duo. Could the love that these two are looking for be closer than they think?

One day, while leaving for school, he is greeted with a surprise: an unfamiliar, older girl in a frilly black dress is waiting by his front door, asking to be friends with him! Despite his attempts at ignoring her, the strange girl determinedly follows Kotarou all the way to school and back. Giving in, Kotarou finds out that the strange girl's name is Misha and that she is his new neighbor, supposedly from Heaven to work on becoming a full-time angel. What will become of Kotarou and his life with this \"clingy angel\"? [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As she does not have any friends and performs poorly at school, her mean-spirited aunt resents having to take care of her. Wholeheartedly believing that God will grant her salvation one day, she tightly holds onto the ring that her mother passed down to her. Seeking solace by spending time at her late cat's grave, Karin unexpectedly meets a boy named Kazune Kuujou, who claims he is looking for God. However, Kazune calls her weak for relying on her deceased cat for comfort. Angered by the insult, Karin subconsciously channels energy into her mother's ring. Soon enough, she begins to excel at school and classmates compliment her for the first time. Unbeknownst to her, the ring has bestowed her godly powers. The revelation of the ring's transcendent strength catches the eyes of not only Kazune but also more sinister figures who wish to take advantage of Karin for nefarious purposes. Karin must now use her newly acquired gift to fight back against these malicious forces, unaware of the truth behind her heritage and the existence of others with similar abilities.

            "synopsis": "It's nearly the end of the century, and one girl has been breaking the news: Kaitou Jeanne, a phantom thief supposedly sent by God, has been stealing paintings all around the city. Her real identity is Maron Kusakabe, a 16-year-old rhythmic gymnastics enthusiast and student at Momokuri Academy— something unknown to all, even her best friend Miyako Toudaiji, who is in charge of the police chase for Jeanne. Hidden inside the paintings Maron steals are demons sent by the demon lord, who plans to weaken God's power by having his minions possess human hearts. Assisted by the minor angel Finn Fish, it is up to Maron as the reincarnation of Jeanne d'Arc to assume her alter ego, hunt down the cursed paintings, and seal the vile demons away. However, the tough job of balancing this duty with her lonesome high school life only proves more challenging when a mysterious new phantom thief makes his appearance—Kaitou Sinbad.

            "synopsis": "Imperial Academy is an elite private school whose student body is divided into the ranks of Gold, Silver, and Bronze. Depending on your family's wealth and your individual merit, you can be classified as a Silver or Bronze student. However, there is only one Gold student, and this year that person is Shizumasa Touguu—nicknamed \"the Emperor\" because he is the Student Council President. When she was very young, Haine Otomiya fell in love with Shizumasa, after reading the children's picture book that he authored. She had met him twice before attending Imperial Academy, but as a Bronze student, her rank is far below his, so she has been unable to approach him at school. Haine jumps at an opportunity to get close to Shizumasa, and she unexpectedly becomes his bodyguard as well as a member of the Student Council. It seems like a dream come true for her, but soon she will learn that everyone in the Student Council is hiding secrets, and her own shameful history cannot be forgotten either.

            "synopsis": "Strawberry panties backdropped against a sunset sky—that was aspiring film director Junpei Manaka's introduction to a mysterious beauty at his middle school. Suspecting the girl is his classmate Aya Toujou, Junpei sets out to get in touch with her to refilm that skirt flip for \"artistic\" reasons. However, when he bumps into her the next day, he sees a girl that looks vastly different from the one in his memories. Just when Junpei thinks he is back to the drawing board, he runs into the school's darling, Tsukasa Nishino, boldly declaring that she is wearing strawberry panties for the day. Convincing himself that Tsukasa is the girl he has been looking for all along, Junpei starts planning his confession—all for the sake of becoming her boyfriend and filming her panties!

            "synopsis": "Randou Masashi is a brash karate star who strikes fear in everyone around him. But despite his intimidating presence, he is secretly in love with the sweet and beautiful Rina Kurimi. Unfortunately, Randou is involved in a horrific bus accident, which leaves him comatose and with a disfigured face. A year later, he awakes to discover something utterly shocking—his face now resembles Rina's! Randou learns that he has been under the care of a surgeon named Jun Manabe, who reconstructed Randou's face based on a picture he had of Rina. Moreover, Randou is presumed dead, and his parents have moved away as a result. Distraught, Randou crosses paths with Rina and is mistaken for her twin sister Yuna, who fled from her house two years ago. Although Randou initially wished to restore his face, seeing Rina elated makes him reconsider his decision. However, a boy disguising himself as a girl is as absurd as it sounds, and being surrounded by troublesome individuals only makes it more difficult. Nevertheless, Randou is adamant about concealing his identity until he finds the real Yuna. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

            "synopsis": "Kippei Katakura is a high school playboy who fills his days with any girl he can. In reality, he only has eyes for one girl in particular—Kokoro Tokunaga. One day, Kippei's family introduces him to his five-year-old cousin, Yuzuru Sakashita, whose mother has abandoned her. Kippei is assigned the task of being Yuzuru's caregiver until her mother returns, and the young girl quickly grows attached to him. Through Yuzuru's influence and the intimate bond that forms between them, Kippei learns not only about childcare, but also about developing meaningful relationships. As Kippei balances his time between Kokoro and Yuzuru, they all grow together and learn more about each other, their feelings, and the true meaning of family. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, he realizes that there is a mystic relationship between pi and the perfect breasts. He conducted research and did calculations to determine what the perfect breasts are but he needed more raw data. Yumeto used to be unpopular and ugly, but to further his quest, he shed blood, sweat and tears to change his appearance and style to that of a handsome young man. When Tamura Jun, a classmate that has been absent for the majority of the school year, returns, Yumeto realizes that she might have the perfect boobs that he has been searching for. But getting to them is going to be harder than he could possibly imagine. (Source: MU)",

But Fukuda Shinichi has one passion: cheering for others! The 18-year-old captain of North Kanto Southern High's Cheerleading squad decides to make the most of his summer by attending cram school in Tokyo, only to find out that the whole trip was a sham! Things are looking up when he and his friend meet up with two cute Tokyo girls; too bad the girls brought them to a rip-off bar and took off! Ditched by his one remaining friend and stuck with an impossibly high bar bill, Fuku-kun's life couldn't get any worse! But just then he gets saved by Ume, his role model and former cheerleading squad captain! What is he doing in Tokyo... and why does everyone around seem to know and respect him? Without anywhere else to go, Fuku-kun decides follow Ume to his job, only to discover that... he's a male gigolo?!? Fukuda's summer of cheering others on has begun... and the streets of Tokyo's red-light district will never be the same!",
